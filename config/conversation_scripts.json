      "[DougDoug] You're probably right about that. The bot problem is getting worse every year!",
      "[Example_Grandma] Monitors will be cheaper around this time of year I think because new monitor models are coming out 'soon'.",
      "[DougDoug] Oh that's a great point! I should wait a bit before upgrading then.",
      "[Example_Grandma] Plus Samsung always has good .edu deals.",
      "[DougDoug] Wait, you know about student discounts? That's impressive!",
      "[Example_Grandma] If looking for a new monitor, I always check rtings.com and Monitors Unboxed on youtube.",
