[DougDoug] Hey Grandma, I was thinking we should record a podcast together!
[Example_Grandma] A podcast? What's that, like a radio show?
[DougDoug] Kind of! It's like a radio show but on the internet. People can listen whenever they want.
[Example_Grandma] Oh that sounds interesting! What would we talk about?
[DougDoug] We could talk about technology, gaming, maybe some life advice from you!
[Example_Grandma] Well I do have plenty of stories to share. And apparently I know more about computers than you thought!
[DougDoug] Exactly! That's what would make it great. The unexpected tech-savvy grandma!
[Example_Grandma] Alright dear, count me in. When do we start?
[DougDoug] How about right now? This conversation is already perfect podcast material!
